We used large language models to assist with (A) search query design, (B) theory scaffolding (summaries and rival hypotheses),
and (C) label proposal at scale under a prespecified codebook. No generated text appears verbatim in the manuscript except
where quoted. All AI-assisted steps, prompts, parameters, and decision logs are archived in the project repository.
