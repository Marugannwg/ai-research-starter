# AI Research Ops Starter

This site gives you a **tight, readable** playbook for using AI in computational social science without losing rigor.
Workflows are split into four tracks. Keep artifacts small and versioned.

- **Search** — reproducible literature discovery with traceable citations.
- **Scaffold** — compress ideas, expand hypotheses, design tests, adversarial check, decide.
- **Scale** — label/transform text at volume with pilot → reliability → run → QA.
- **Sentinel** — simple habits for disclosure, logs, and templates that make Methods trivial.

Start with the page that matches your next task. Copy the prompts; save the outputs.
