# Sentinel

**Goal:** Small, repeatable habits that keep you honest and make writing Methods painless.

**Daily (takes ~1 minute per AI interaction)**
```
[time] PURPOSE: search | scaffold | scale
INPUTS: files/prompts/models
OUTPUT/DECISION: what changed + TODO
```

**Weekly**
- Roll up to `logs/ai/weekly_[date].md`: which models, which tasks, where outputs were used.

**At milestones**
- Update oneâ€‘page **Datasheet** for any dataset you created via AI.
- Add a mini **Model Card** for any classifier/prompt you rely on.

Templates live in `notes/templates/`. Keep them short. Save everything in the repo.
