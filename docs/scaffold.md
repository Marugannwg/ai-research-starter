# Scaffold

**Goal:** Structure your thinking—short artifacts, explicit assumptions, visible trade‑offs.

**Five‑phase loop**
1. **Compress**: concept map + causal diagram with uncertainties.
2. **Expand**: hypothesis tree with measurable outcomes and falsification paths.
3. **Design**: identification strategy, minimal dataset, assumptions, threats, pre‑analysis notes.
4. **Adversarial**: strongest counter‑stories and how to distinguish them empirically.
5. **Decide**: a one‑page research charter with go/no‑go criteria and next step.

Paste the prompt from `prompts/SCAFFOLD_generic.yaml`. Save the final **charter** to `notes/research_charter_[date].md`.
