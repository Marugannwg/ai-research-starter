task: >
  We will iterate through five phases on "{{TOPIC}}":
  (1) COMPRESS (concept map + causal diagram with uncertainties),
  (2) EXPAND (hypothesis tree with measurable outcomes and falsification paths),
  (3) DESIGN (identification plan, minimal dataset, assumptions, threats, pre‑analysis outline),
  (4) ADVERSARIAL (strongest counter‑stories and empirical discriminators),
  (5) DECIDE (200‑word research charter with explicit go/no‑go criteria and next action).
return_rules:
  - At each phase, return only the artifact plus five checkable assumptions.
  - Keep language compact. No rhetorical filler.
inputs:
  TOPIC: "e.g., effect of automated moderation on newcomer retention in online communities"
output_artifacts:
  - "mermaid diagrams allowed for concept/causal structures"
  - "final: research_charter.md section ready to paste"
